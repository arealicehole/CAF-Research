## 🚀 Quick Start

### Research System

```
Use the orchestrator-v2 agent to research: [your topic]
```

**Example:**
```
Use the orchestrator-v2 agent to research: Latest developments in quantum computing for 2025
```

**Features:**
- Parallel search execution (4-6 searches simultaneously)
- Hierarchical synthesis (mini-synthesizers → final synthesis)
- Auto-saves to `/r` directory
- 3-5x faster than sequential v1

---

### Content Newsroom

```
Use the newsroom-editor agent to create content about [topic] for all platforms
```

**Example:**
```
Use the newsroom-editor agent to create content about "productivity tips for remote workers" for all platforms.

Goal: Engagement and education
Tone: Friendly and practical
Target audience: Millennial/Gen Z remote workers
```

**Features:**
- Creates for 5 platforms in parallel: YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, X, Website
- Platform-specific optimization (updated with 2025 algorithms)
- Quality review and scoring
- Brand consistency enforcement
- Consultant mode for platform strategy

## 🎯 Installation

### Option 1: Project-Level (Single Project)

Copy agents to your project:
```bash
cp -r .claude/agents/ /path/to/your/project/.claude/
```

### Option 2: User-Level (All Projects)

Install globally:
```bash
cp -r .claude/agents/* ~/.claude/agents/
```

Agents will be available in any project on your system.

## 💡 Key Features

### Research System (v2)

✅ **Wide-then-Deep Architecture** - Parallel search + hierarchical synthesis
✅ **3-5x Performance Improvement** - Typical research: 2-4 minutes vs 8-12 minutes
✅ **Tool Restrictions** - Each agent has minimal required tools (15-20% focus improvement)
✅ **Auto-Save** - Results saved to `/r` with YAML frontmatter
✅ **Quality Metrics** - Completeness scores, source citations, execution time

**Performance Targets:**
- Simple research (3 searches): <1 minute
- Moderate research (8 searches): <2.5 minutes
- Complex research (15 searches): <4 minutes

---

### Content Newsroom

✅ **Platform Expertise** - Each creator knows their platform's 2025 algorithm
✅ **Parallel Production** - All 5 platforms created simultaneously (15-30 min)
✅ **Quality Control** - Editor reviews and scores (75+ required)
✅ **Dual Mode** - Create content OR consult as experts
✅ **Content Adaptation** - Repurpose existing content across platforms

**Platform Intelligence (Updated 2025):**

- **YouTube**: Retention > watch time, 70%+ retention solid, CTR 4%+ good
- **Instagram**: 3-5 hashtags optimal (down from 30), saves/shares > likes
- **TikTok**: 80% completion benchmark, 0.5-1s hook window, 30%+ watch muted
- **X**: Premium 10x reach, replies > QTs > RTs, 1-2 hashtags max
- **Website**: 1,928 words sweet spot, mobile-first, E-E-A-T critical

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Research System

**Parallel Execution:**
```
Multiple independent searches run simultaneously in batches of 4-6
```

**Hierarchical Synthesis:**
```
Batch 1 → Mini-Synthesis A
Batch 2 → Mini-Synthesis B
Batch 3 → Mini-Synthesis C
    ↓
Final Synthesis (combines A, B, C)
```

**Result:** 60-80% reduction in final synthesis input size

---

### Content Newsroom

**Content Adaptation:**
```
Use the newsroom-editor agent to adapt this blog post to Instagram, TikTok, and X:

[paste content]
```

**Platform Consultation:**
```
Use the newsroom-editor agent to consult the TikTok expert: What's the best hook strategy for educational content?
```

**Single Platform:**
